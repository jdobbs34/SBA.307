## About
Website is about food and cooking made of 3 pages. The home page talks about why creator enjoys cooking then presents some funny gifs and pictures. Then he speak about the purpose of his page which is to create a community of people sharing their recipes.


In the nav bar there is a dropdown in recipes to pick a category for you recipe to be in. Examples would be desserts, main courses, and appetizers. The Contact page is where you sign up to make a post and would be made up of 2 forms. One would be for personal info such as Name and email. The other would be for recipe name, ingredients, and photos you would like to add to post.

Had issue with dropdown and almost felt like using AI but then I found this to help me out https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_dropdown_text. Also have my 2 animation in home page. One over the nav bar and the other will be on the Gifs and images.
